                        You are responsible for keeping up to date with these Terms of Use. By continuing to use this website, you agree to be bound by these terms. If you do not agree, you must stop using the platform immediately.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To register as a BER Assessor on this website, you must be a qualified and registered BER Assessor with the Irish governing body, currently the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). By registering, you confirm that your registration with SEAI is current and valid. You also agree to notify theberman.eu immediately via email if your registration status changes or if you cease to be a registered BER Assessor.

                    <p>
                        While theberman.eu aims to offer opportunities to all Assessors on the platform, there is no guarantee or commitment to provide a specific number of job referrals. The acceptance of any quotes submitted by Assessors is solely at the discretion of the client (homeowner), and theberman.eu has no influence over their decision.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By using theberman.eu, you agree to contact any clients obtained through theberman.eu within one business day of receiving a job referral.

                        When submitting quotes through theberman.eu, you agree to include all applicable fees in your total quoted price. This includes all applicable SEAI fees, VAT (if applicable), and the theberman.eu referral fee.

                        By using theberman.eu, you understand and agree that the theberman.eu fee of €30 is a referral fee for providing you with a confirmed job.

                        By using theberman.eu, you agree not to subcontract any jobs acquired through theberman.eu to third parties. All work must be performed and completed by you, the BER Assessor registered with theberman.eu.
